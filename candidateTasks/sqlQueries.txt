Tables (pseudocode):

user {
id integer auto_increment,
name vachar
}

salary {
id integer auto_increment,
userId integer, # link to user table
dateofSalary timestamp, # date/time when user received salary
sum decimal
}

Task:
All tasks should be resolved by ONE SQL query (no php loops),
user name should be listed in results of query


a) Design SQL which lists user(s) with biggest total salary from April to November.
Show user name and overall salary amount
b) Design SQL which shows users who haven't received salary yet



CREATE DATABASE my_db;

CREATE TABLE User(
id int NOT NULL,
name varchar(255) NOT NULL,
PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

CREATE TABLE salary(
id int NOT NULL,
userId int NOT NULL,
dateofSalary timestamp,
sum decimal, 
PRIMARY KEY (id)
);







select user.id, user.name, sum(salary.sum) AS Total from user inner join salary on user.id=salary.userId 
where dateofSalary between 04-01-2016 and 11-01-2016
HAVING MAX(Total);
